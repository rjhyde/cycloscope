# CycloScope

CycloScope is an interactive web app for visualizing and teaching the fundamentals of Cyclostationary Signal Processing (CSP). It is designed for educators, researchers, and students to explore CSP concepts with real-time, interactive controls and visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `client/` — React + TypeScript frontend for interactive signal generation, visualization, and user controls.
- `server/` — Node.js backend for future API endpoints and advanced signal processing logic.

## Getting Started

1. **Frontend:**
   - `cd client`
   - `npm start`
2. **Backend:**
   - `cd server`
   - `npm start` (to be implemented)

## Planned Features
- Interactive signal generator with sliders for parameters (frequency, amplitude, noise, etc.)
- Real-time plots: time domain, frequency domain, and spectral correlation
- Nonlinear operations and higher-order statistics
- Educational popups and guided tutorials
- Export and sharing options
