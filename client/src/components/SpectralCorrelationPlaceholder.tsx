    <h3>Spectral Correlation (CSP) Plot [Coming Soon]</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Spectral correlation</strong> is a key tool in cyclostationary signal processing. It reveals periodicities in the frequency domain that are hidden in ordinary spectra, allowing detection and analysis of modulated or cyclostationary signals even in the presence of noise and interference.<br /><br />
      This plot will visualize the cyclic spectral content of your signal, showing how energy is distributed across both frequency and cyclic frequency axes.
